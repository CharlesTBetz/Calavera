The last 3 weeks have marked Calavera's debut in a classroom setting. It has been a lot of work and very exciting for both me and (I think) the students. This week, they are [standing up their own instances of the Manos development environment](https://github.com/StThomas-SEIS660/Lab-04/blob/master/Lab-04-inststructions.md).

Been doing some final polishing. The public Calavera alpha release is delayed due to my educational commitments - have to prioritize creating the labs. Testing the system under fire in the classroom also seems appropriate before publishing.

But a motivated person can certainly download and stand up the virtual machines at this point. I have started a dedicated [installation instructions wiki](https://github.com/CharlesTBetz/Calavera/wiki/Installation-instructions).
